Git Key Manager
===============

A system tray application for managing SSH keys for Git operations.

Features:
- Visual indicator (green = keys loaded, red = no keys)
- Easy key loading with one click
- Support for multiple SSH keys
- GitHub connection testing
- System tray integration

Usage:
1. Click the system tray icon to open the manager
2. Add your SSH keys (usually in ~/.ssh/)
3. Click on a key name to load it
4. Green indicator = ready to push/pull without credentials
5. Red indicator = no key loaded

The application will ensure ssh-agent is running and manage your keys
automatically. As long as the indicator is green, you won't need to
enter credentials for Git operations.
